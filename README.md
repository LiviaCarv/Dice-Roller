# Dice Roller App

This Android app, developed during the "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin" course offered by Udacity, serves as a basic introduction to Android app development. 
The app simulates rolling a six-sided die and displays the result along with a toast message.

## Overview

The main functionality is implemented in the `MainActivity.kt` file. The app features a button (btn_roll) that, when clicked, triggers the rollDice function. 
The `ImageView` (img_dice) displays the result of the dice roll, and a toast message informs the user of the outcome.
